Create new bullet patterns

Make more levels (scripted enemies?)

Improve enemy movement
-Enemies coming from off screen with paused shooting
-Not getting trapped in corners

New bullet types?
-Lasers
-Larger orbs

Make the actual level generated ( for multiple players). Prefabs?

Lives?

Get Pause Working

Limit on spellcards + GUI for Spellcards

Bonus points for near misses?

Work on collision detection

Bosses (custom spellcards)

More sprites

Look into particles for projectiles (May need to use Unity 5.2, possible to use new particle system) (Use of sprites is going to be the chokepoint)

Better Background

Make the player character and sprites more clear (focus is only partially on player so needs to stand out. maybe an outline? Or a simple and moving background)
